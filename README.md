# poke-generator
This is a Pokemon generator made using PokeAPI, Axios, and Webpack, written in vanilla JavaScript und CSS. Just for fun :)

The webpage returns a random Pokemon 'card' (made with CSS) in your browser. You can also search for specific Pokemon that you want to see. I use a JS constructor to 'create' each pokemon dynamically using data from PokeAPI. 

As I improve my CSS skills, learn SASS, and learn more about Webpack asset management, I plan to upgrade the look of the cards and add animations.

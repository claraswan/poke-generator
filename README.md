# poke-generator
This is a random Pokemon generator made using PokeAPI, Axios, and Webpack, written in vanilla JavaScript und CSS. Just for fun :)

The webpage returns a random Pokemon 'card' (made with CSS) in your browser. I use a JS constructor to 'create' each pokemon dynamically from PokeAPI, every time the button on the page is clicked. 

As I improve my CSS skills, learn SASS, and become more comfortable with Webpack, I plan to upgrade the look of the cards and add animations.
